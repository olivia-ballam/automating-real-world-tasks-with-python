# Scale and Convert Images Using PIL
## Project Problem Statment 

Write a script that processes a bunch of images. 

It turns out that your company is in the process of updating its website, and a design contractor has been hired to create some new icon graphics for the site. However, the contrator has delivered the final designs and they're in the wrong format, rotated 90Â° and too large. You're unable to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You'll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch!

So, how will you do this? You'll need to go through a folder full of images abd operate with each of them. On each image you'll use PIL methods and then write the new images in the right place.
