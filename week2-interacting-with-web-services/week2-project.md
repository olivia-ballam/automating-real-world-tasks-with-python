# Week 2 Interacting with Web Services

Write a script that interacts with a running web service. The web service is a part of your company's website and is in charge of storing and displaying customer reviews of the company. 

The reviews are stored in text files in the local disk. Your script should open those files, process the information to turn it inot the format expected by the web service, then send it to the web service to get stored. 

### Introduction
You’re working at a company that sells second-hand cars. Your company constantly collects feedback in the form of customer reviews. Your manager asks you to take those reviews (saved as .txt files) and display them on your company’s website. To do this, you’ll need to write a script to convert those .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, then upload the data onto your company’s website (currently using Django).

### What you’ll do
- Use the Python OS module to process a directory of text files 

- Manage information stored in Python dictionaries

- Use the Python requests module to upload content to a running Web service

- Understand basic operations for Python requests like GET and POST methods
